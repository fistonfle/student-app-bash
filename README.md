# Student Registration System

This is a student management system in bash that registers students' details into the ALU registration system. This allows the user to enter student email, age, and id inputs in which are taken, loaded, and built in the Bachelor of Software Engineering cohort list of students.

# Make sure both scripts (main.sh and select-emails.sh) have execution permissions:

chmod +x main.sh select-emails.sh move-to-directory.sh backup-Negpod_16.sh
